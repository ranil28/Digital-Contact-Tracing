## 1.	Introduction

Digital Contact Tracing adopted here is based on Case investigation and contact tracing, a core disease control measure employed by local and state health department personnel for decades. It is a key strategy for preventing further spread of COVID-19. 
We have employed keeping in mind both the manual efforts required to keep track of patient’s records also known as case management, and proximity tracing which is purely a technical approach. Technology can support case investigation and contact tracing but cannot take the place of a trained public health workforce for interviewing, counseling, and providing support for those impacted by COVID-19.
The PACT (Private Automated Contact Tracing) protocol describes digital contact tracing as a simple, decentralized approach to using smartphones for contact tracing based on Bluetooth proximity. To promote automated support for tools while understanding and adopting the protocol, we have covered a few essential principles for the data management, namely:

**Patient Identification**

**Contact Elicitation / Identification** 

**Contact Notification** 

**Patient / Contact Follow up and Monitoring** 

**Personal Privacy and Data Security**

**Localization**

**Workflow Management and Reporting**

## 2.	Assumptions

Before having a glance at the models, we have laid out certain key assumptions that would bind Digital Contact Tracing to limited expectations:

•	All the users of the application will have their basic information stored which unless required will not be available to sharing or viewing per se.

•	The models are designed keeping in mind that persons can share same residential addresses but can have unique email ids and phone numbers.

•	We have considered Person and AppUser as abstract classes and are related through disjoint generalization with their children.

•	If a user is tested to be positive, they will have to self-report themselves as positive in the application and thereon, will be referred to as a Patient.

•	This data will be validated by a health professional or health investigator who can also be an authorized user who can view specific information of contacts and patients.

•	The patient could have had contact with no or many people and thus those contacts are at the risk of getting the virus depending on certain factors, like, distance between the patient and the contact, duration of their meet and wearing masks or not. 

•	If a contact is tested positive, he/she will be moved to patient table and deleted from the contact table. And then the contacts of the infected contact(who's a patient now) will be enlisted in the contacts table. 

•	The distances are to be calculated electronically by using BLE technology which is based on Signal strength.

•	These contacts as are part of the application, will be notified by means of customized and automated Text, Voice Message, Call or Email.

•	Following that, the contact should self-report their data into the application and thus health investigator will determine what medication to provide.

•	Both patients and contacts can report symptoms and their severity in the app. An app user can have 0 or more symptoms.

•	A health investigator will follow-up with both patients and contacts for a period of 14 days to know their condition. 

•	Alongside, the patients or contacts will be provided with mandatory Services as and when opted for.

•	Although the data privacy is maintained and periodic cleanup is done, the symptoms and location details of the patient and contacts are being stored for history purposes to be used in case of reoccurrence of the disease and analysis purpose.

## 3. Conceptual Model 

A conceptual model ensures that not only various entities of an organization and relationships are represented but also other components such as functional modules of the software system, interactions among them, user interactions with the system are also visualized. Such components can be specified using a standard called Unified Modeling Language (UML) which is illustrated in the diagram below- 

![Fig 3.1 :Conceptual Model for Digital Contact Tracing in Enterprise Architect](D:/NEU/5200 DBMS/Practicum1/ConceptualGroup16.jpg)



## 4. Logical Model 

A logical data model or logical schema is a data model of a specific problem domain expressed independently of a database management tool but in terms of data structures such as relational tables and columns, object-oriented classes, or XML tags. Here, a logical model is represented as an entity relationship diagram in IE notation using relations.

![Fig 4.1 :Logical Model for Digital Contact Tracing in Lucid Chart](D:/NEU/5200 DBMS/Practicum1/LogicalGroup16.jpg)

[Logical Model](https://app.lucidchart.com/documents/edit/3095418d-d984-41e0-a753-30a497bc2b2f/0_0?shared=true#?folder_id=home&browser=icon)

## 5. Relational Schema 

A relational schema of a relation name R and a set of attributes A1, A2, A3.. An and is represented as R(A1, A2, A3.. An). The logical model shown above can be resolved into following schemas. 


Person (<u>pId</u>, email,pFirstName,pLastName,phoneNumber,gender,age,*addressId*)

Location (<u>addressId</u>,blockNumber,street,*zipCode*)

Zip (<u>zipCode</u>, city, state)

HealthInvestigator (<u>*pId*</u>,hOrganization, qualification,roleName)

AppUser (<u>*pId*</u>,aLanguage,loggingDate,testResult)

Patient (<u>*pId*</u>,healthReportValidated,typeOfTreatment, recovered) 

Contact (<u>*pId*,*notificationId*</u>) 

AuthorisedUser (<u>userId</u>,userPassword,accessLevel,*pId*)

Notification (<u>notificationId</u>,nMode, instructions,notificationTime,*hId*) 

Meets (<u>*patientId*,*contactId*</u>, distance,startTime,endTime,maskWorn)

Has (<u>*pId*,*sId*</u>) 

Symptom (<u>sId</u>,sName, severity) 

IsProvided (<u>*pId*,*serviceId*</u>) 

Service (<u>*serviceId*</u>,serviceType) 

Views (<u>*userId*,*pId*</u>) 

FollowUp (<u>followUpId</u>,followUpDay,symptomCheck,temperatureInF,*pId*,*hId*) 

## 6. Functional Dependencies 

A relational schema R is considered to be in Boyce–Codd normal form (BCNF) if, for every one of its dependencies X → Y, one of the following conditions holds true: 
 
•	X → Y is a TRIVIAL FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY (i.e., Y is a subset of X) 

•	X is a SUPERKEY for schema R 

**Person** : 

pId -> pFirstName, pLastName, gender, age, addressId 

email-> pFirstName, pLastName,gender, age,addressId 

phoneNumber-> pFirstName,pLastName,gender, age,addressId 

(Here, there are 3 candidate keys: pId, email and phoneNumber which uniquely identifies non-key attributes (pFirstName, pLastName, gender, age, addressId ) which satisfies BCNF) 

**Location** :  addressId ->  blockNumber, street, zipCode 

**Zip**: zipCode -> city, state     

**HealthInvestigator** :  pId -> hOrganization, qualification, roleName 

**AppUser** :  pId ->  aLanguage, loggingDate, testResult 

**Patient**  : pid -> healthReportValidated, typeOfTreatment, recovered 

**Contact** :  pid ->  notificationId 

**AuthorisedUser** :

userId ->  userPassword, accessLevel

pId -> userPassword, accessLevel  

(Here, there are 2 candidate keys: userId and pId which uniquely identifies non-key attributes (userPassword, accessLevel) which satisfies BCNF) 
 
**Notification** :  notificationId  ->  nMode, instructions, notificationTime, hId 

**Meets** :  patientId, contactId ->  distance, startTime, endTime, maskWorn 

**Has** :  pId, sId    (Super Key which validates BCNF) 

**Symptom** : sId ->  sName, severity 

**IsProvided** :  pId, servicId    (Super Key which validates BCNF) 

**Service** : serviceId -> serviceType 

**Views** :  userId, pId     (Super Key which validates BCNF) 

**FollowUp** : followUpId ->  followUpDay, symptomCheck, temperatureInF, pId, hId
